LobsterAI is a desktop Agent that can operate in your real working environment: local files, terminal commands, browser workflows, documents, spreadsheets, slides, IM channels, scheduled jobs, and project workspaces.

Cowork is the LobsterAI product/session layer. OpenClaw is the runtime and gateway underneath it. That split lets LobsterAI keep local persistence, permissions, UI state, artifacts, agents, memory, and IM bindings in the desktop app while using OpenClaw for agent execution.

## Features

### Desktop Cowork Sessions

Run long-form Agent tasks against local projects and files. LobsterAI streams progress, keeps session history, renders tool output, and asks for approval before sensitive actions such as file operations, terminal commands, or network access.

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Create custom Agents with their own identity, model choice, skills, working directory, enabled state, and IM bindings. Keep the Main Agent for general work and use specialized Agents for repeatable roles.

### Expert Kits

Install scenario-oriented Expert Kits that package capability selections and references for common workflows. Kits are selected independently from direct skills, so a workflow can combine curated kits with individual tools.

### Skills

LobsterAI ships with 28 built-in skills configured in `SKILLs/skills.config.json`, including web search, Word documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoint, PDF processing, Remotion video generation, browser automation, image/video generation, stock research, content writing, email, weather, and skill creation.

### MCP Servers

Connect external tools and data sources through Model Context Protocol servers. LobsterAI stores user-configured servers locally and syncs enabled servers into OpenClaw.

### Scheduled Tasks

Create recurring work either by conversation or through the scheduled task UI. Use it for daily news digests, inbox summaries, website monitoring, weekly reports, and other repeatable work.

### IM Remote Control

Reach your desktop Agent from WeChat, WeCom, DingTalk, Feishu/Lark, QQ, Telegram, Discord, NetEase IM, NetEase Bee, POPO, and email. Multi-instance platforms can bind different accounts or channels to different Agents.

### Rich Artifacts

Preview and manage generated HTML, SVG, images, video, Mermaid diagrams, code, Markdown, text, documents, and local service artifacts inside the desktop app.

### Local Memory And Data

Sessions and app data live locally in SQLite. OpenClaw workspace memory uses files such as `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, and daily notes, so durable preferences and project context can carry across sessions.

## Real-World Prompts

| Scenario | Example prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Build a local system | "I still track inventory and sales in Excel. Build a local inventory system that records purchases and sales, calculates stock and profit, and opens in my browser." |
| Analyze local data | "Use `product-growth.xlsx` to build a visual dashboard and summarize the main growth drivers." |
| Generate a deck | "Research the AI Agent market and turn the findings into a presentation." |
| Automate browser checks | "Open the ads dashboard every morning, check spend and conversion anomalies, and summarize likely causes." |
| Screen documents | "Turn the resumes in this folder into a screening sheet and shortlist the strongest candidates against the JD." |
| Run scheduled work | "Every weekday at 9 AM, collect yesterday's AI news and send me a concise digest." |

## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/res/architecture_v2_en.png" alt="LobsterAI architecture" width="640">
</p>

- **Renderer**: React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind, artifact renderers, settings, agent/session UI, skills, MCP, scheduled tasks, and IM configuration.
- **Main process**: Electron lifecycle, IPC, SQLite persistence, auth, logging, OpenClaw startup, runtime repair, skill sync, IM gateways, and artifact services.
- **OpenClaw integration**: `openclawEngineManager`, `openclawConfigSync`, `openclawRuntimeAdapter`, and `coworkEngineRouter` translate LobsterAI state into OpenClaw runtime behavior.

## Install

### Desktop

Download the latest macOS and Windows installers from [Official Website](https://lobsterai.youdao.com/) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/netease-youdao/LobsterAI/releases).

### Run From Source

Requirements:

- Node.js `>=24.15.0 <25`
- npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netease-youdao/LobsterAI.git
cd LobsterAI
npm install
```

First development run:

```bash
npm run electron:dev:openclaw
```

Daily development after the pinned OpenClaw runtime exists:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

The renderer dev server runs at `http://localhost:5175`.

## Developing

```bash
# Production renderer bundle
npm run build

# Electron main/preload TypeScript build
npm run compile:electron

# Official Vitest entry used by CI
npm test

# Full ESLint across src; may expose existing legacy debt
npm run lint

# CI-style lint for touched TypeScript files
npx eslint --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0 <files>
```

### OpenClaw Runtime

The pinned OpenClaw version and third-party plugin list live in `package.json` under `openclaw`.

```bash
# Build the current-platform runtime manually
npm run openclaw:runtime:host

# Use a custom OpenClaw source checkout
OPENCLAW_SRC=/path/to/openclaw npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Force runtime rebuild
OPENCLAW_FORCE_BUILD=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw

# Keep a local OpenClaw checkout on its current branch/tag
OPENCLAW_SKIP_ENSURE=1 npm run electron:dev:openclaw
```

### ccbt Runtime (Second Agent Engine)

ccbt ([claude-code-best-thank](https://github.com/yeardlry/claude-code-best-thank)) is the second cowork agent engine (ACP protocol over stdio), running side by side with OpenClaw. The pinned ccbt version and Bun version live in `package.json` under `ccbt`. See `docs/` and `scripts/build-ccbt-runtime.sh` in the ccbt repository for the full integration plan.

```bash
# Assemble vendor/ccbt-runtime/current for the current platform
npm run ccbt:runtime:mac-arm64   # also: mac-x64, win-x64, linux-x64

# ACP round-trip smoke test against the assembled runtime
npm run ccbt:verify

# Build from a custom ccbt source checkout / force rebuild / reuse existing dist
CCBT_SRC=/path/to/ccbt npm run ccbt:runtime:mac-arm64
CCBT_FORCE_BUILD=1 npm run ccbt:runtime:mac-arm64
CCBT_SKIP_BUILD=1 npm run ccbt:runtime:mac-arm64
```

Two deliberate build decisions (recorded 2026-08-16):

1. **The bundled Bun binary does NOT come from GitHub Releases.** Direct
   GitHub downloads are unreliable on this network (SSL timeouts / 404).
   Instead: when the build host platform matches the target and the local
   `bun --version` equals the pinned version, the local binary is copied;
   otherwise the official `@oven/bun-<os>-<arch>@<version>` npm platform
   package is fetched via `npm pack`, which works through any npm registry
   mirror (e.g. npmmirror). Both are Bun's official distribution channels.
2. **The source-clone flow is not yet usable.** The ccbt repository has no
   git tags, so `git clone --branch <version>` cannot resolve. The build
   script first looks for a local checkout at `../claude-code-best-thank` or
   `../../ClaudeCode/claude-code-best-thank`, and only falls back to cloning
   `ccbt.repo` at tag `ccbt.version`. Publishing tags in the ccbt repository
   enables the clone flow for CI.

## Packaging

<details>
<summary>Build desktop installers</summary>

```bash
# macOS
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:mac:x64
npm run dist:mac:arm64
npm run dist:mac:universal

# Windows
npm run dist:win

# Linux
npm run dist:linux
```

Packaging bundles the OpenClaw runtime under `Resources/cfmind`. Windows builds also bundle a portable Python runtime under `resources/python-win`, so end users do not need to install Python manually.

Offline or private-source packaging can use:

- `LOBSTERAI_PORTABLE_PYTHON_ARCHIVE`
- `LOBSTERAI_PORTABLE_PYTHON_URL`
- `LOBSTERAI_WINDOWS_EMBED_PYTHON_VERSION`
- `LOBSTERAI_WINDOWS_EMBED_PYTHON_URL`
- `LOBSTERAI_WINDOWS_GET_PIP_URL`

</details>

## Security And Data

- Renderer windows use context isolation, disabled Node integration, and sandboxing.
- Renderer-to-main access goes through preload IPC APIs.
- Sensitive tool actions are permission-gated and logged.
- App data is stored locally in `lobsterai.sqlite` under Electron `userData`.
- OpenClaw state, workspace memory, generated config, and gateway logs live under `userData/openclaw`.
